- **User Story 15: Conduct End-to-End Testing using WebdriverIO**
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: End-to-end test cases defined and executed using WebdriverIO.
  - **Verification**: No evidence of end-to-end testing implementation.

**2. Code Review and Quality Check:**

- **main.py**:
  - **Issues**:
    - Syntax errors in the `call_sap_ai_core` function (missing `` argument, incomplete return statement).
    - Missing or incomplete Security and SAP AI Core integration logic.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Fix syntax errors and complete the implementation of `call_sap_ai_core`.
    - Add proper logging and error handling.

- **test_main.py**:
  - **Issues**:
    - Syntax errors in test functions (missing `` argument, incomplete assertions).
    - No tests for all implemented endpoints.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Fix syntax errors in the test functions.
    - Add comprehensive tests for all endpoints.

- **GitHub Workflows**:
  - **Issues**:
    - Deployment workflow is present but needs verification.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Ensure the deployment workflow is tested and functional.

**3. Security and Best Practices:**

- **Issues**:
  - Hardcoded tokens and API keys in the code.
  - Missing data encryption in transit and at rest.
  - Lack of comprehensive logging and error handling.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Implement data encryption mechanisms.
  - Add comprehensive logging and error handling.
