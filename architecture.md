# SAP CAP Digital Assistant Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction and Goals

### Overview of the Project
The objective of this project is to develop a Minimum Viable SAP CAP application that functions as a digital assistant. This assistant will leverage SAP AI services for natural language processing and SAP UI5/Fiori for the frontend interface. The goal is to enhance user experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure seamless integration with the SAP ecosystem.

### Goals and Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
- Develop an intuitive and interactive platform for users to submit queries and receive responses in natural language.
- Seamlessly integrate the application with existing SAP systems to leverage existing data and processes.
- Automate query handling to reduce the workload on customer support teams.
- Ensure scalability, security, and high performance of the application.

## 2. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
The high-level architecture of the digital assistant consists of the following components:
- **SAP CAP Application**: The core application built using the SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) model.
- **SAP AI Services**: Services for natural language processing and response generation.
- **SAP UI5/Fiori Frontend**: A user-friendly chat interface for users to interact with the digital assistant.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Mechanisms using XSUAA to ensure secure access.
- **SAP Hana Database**: A scalable and high-performance database to store application data.
- **App Router**: Routes requests to the appropriate services.
- **SAP Cloud Foundry**: The platform for deploying and managing the application.
- **Logging and Monitoring Tools**: Tools for tracking usage and performance metrics.

### Detailed Architecture Components
1. **SAP CAP Application**:
